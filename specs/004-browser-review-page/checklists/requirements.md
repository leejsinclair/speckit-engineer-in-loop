## Notes

- The readers of this spec are developers using the extension, as with 001 to 003. It therefore names concepts the constitution itself uses (per-session token, origin, record file, the standard-library constraint) but no framework, module or wire format.
- The three clarifications (FR-016, FR-020, FR-021) were answered by the repository owner on 2026-10-04 and are recorded under Clarifications. All items pass.
